# 205. Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
**Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"
**Output:** true
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
**Input:** s = "foo", t = "bar"
**Output:** false
</pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre>
**Input:** s = "paper", t = "title"
**Output:** true
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
* `t.length == s.length`
* `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.
